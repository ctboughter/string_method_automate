#init_vacuum Instructions

So here in this directory are two files, one from the result of the init_equil directory,
the other is the input for running the first of these vacuum simulations. init_avg.0.out
is moved from init_equil/namd/example_outputs/avg.0.out. Then put in the bottom of the
colvars file and allowed to run. I'll assume you already know how to submit this simulation
from this *.inp file and also re-run newcenters_average.sh
